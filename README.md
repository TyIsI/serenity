# Serenity (working title)

Inspired by the [Momentum Dash](https://momentumdash.com/) extension for Chrome, I wanted to see if I could:
- create something that's similar to the extension, but more customizable, works in multiple browsers, and modifiable by the user
- learn some new-to-me technologies:
  - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- do something with [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)

## Usage

* Clone/fork the repository
* Install the modules (`yarn install`)
* Get a key from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)
* Copy the `env.local.sample` to `.env.local` and put in the relevant values (and update the UNSPLASH_COLLECTION_IDS if wanted)
* Run `yarn start`

## Goals
* Make it customizable
  * Configurable collections per user/client
* More apps
* Synchronized configuration

> Note: This is a work in progress
